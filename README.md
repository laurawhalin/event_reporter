This is a collaborative project for the Turing School of Software and Design. The application pulls from a CSV file and allows for queries to be run on the data as well as displaying the queries. Queries can also be saved to a seperate CSV file with a name of your choosing. Once a file has been saved, the CSV can be read and queried the same as the original file.
